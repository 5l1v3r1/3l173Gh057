Fyi, the .ipynb is python file code that i created & run in jupyter notebook
(quite pain in the a** to use windows & python, I used anaconda to ensure my 
complex packages are complete whenever I'm using Windows----Linux users--congrats)

.py as well known is the usual python file.


Enjoy! ??


What this does:
1- Show your Mac ADDRESS

2- change your mac address randomly

3- change your mac address custumly

4- reset the origin Mac Address

5- give you reasons to change your mac address


--I just started to write these kind of things, lemme know if something's wrong
so I could fix it.

Thanks!
