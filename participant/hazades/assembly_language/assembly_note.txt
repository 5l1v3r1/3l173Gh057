#Assembly_Language(AL)

Assembler -- Source code of AL --> machine language
Linker    -- Utility of combined file created by assembler into .exe

Example of translating HLL(high level language--programming language like java, C and etc) into AL.

C:-

int y;
int x = (y+4)*3;

so to translate this C into AL is:-

mov eax, y	;move y to eax register
add eax, 4	;add 4 to eax
mov ebx, 3	;move 3 to ebx
imul ebx	;multiply eax by ebx
mov x, eax	;move eax value to x
